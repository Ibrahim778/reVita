# reVita v.1.0 | [Wiki](../../wiki) | [PS TV Configs](https://github.com/DerpyBubblez/reVita-Configs)
**reVita** is a plugin for PS Vita / PS TV, which allows you to remap inputs and trigger different actions. It is a continuation of [Rinnegatamante](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante)'s **[remaPSV](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/remaPSV)**, which was fully rewritten as a kernel plugin.

[Here](https://github.com/DerpyBubblez/reVita-Configs) you can find ready to use [PS TV Configs](https://github.com/DerpyBubblez/reVita-Configs) by [Derpy](https://github.com/DerpyBubblez)

- **[DSMotion](https://github.com/OperationNT414C/DSMotion)** - not compatible, use **[DS34Motion](https://github.com/MERLev/DS34Motion)** instead to get full support.

### Compatibility with Apps

- Adrenaline - to get UI working, you need to change **Adrenaline Settings -> Graphics Filtering** to anything else **except** original.
- In some of hombrews and PSP/PS1 games GUI won't work - use **Shared profile** method for them. [[How To]](https://github.com/MERLev/reVita#known-issues).

## Installation

- Copy **[ioplus.skprx](https://github.com/MERLev/reVita/releases/download/1.0/ioplus.skprx)** to **ur0:/tai** folder, add **ioplus.skprx** into your **ur0:/config.txt** config file under ***KERNEL*** section.
- Copy **reVita.skprx** to **ur0:/tai** folder, add **reVita.skprx** into your **ur0:/config.txt** config file under ***KERNEL*** section. Should be installed **before** ***ds34vita***/***ds4touch*** in tai config.
- [Optional, to get Gyro support] Copy **reVitaMotion.suprx** to **ur0:/tai** folder, add **reVitaMotion.suprx** into your **ur0:/config.txt** config file under ***MAIN*** section.

## Usage

- To bring the config menu, press **START + SQUARE**, customisable under Settings -> Hotkeys.
- Read more on the [Wiki](../../wiki)

## FAQ

- How to open plugin menu ?
  - Press (start) + (square)
- What can you do with gyro ?
  - You can remap gyro direction (up, down, left, right) to right stick directions to enable gyro aim in any game.
- Is there a way to turn it on and off?
  - **START + TRIANGLE**, customisable under Settings -> Hotkeys
- Does it save presets on a game by game basis?
  - Yes, you can use Profile -> Profile Management for more options.
- What is deadband under gyro menu ?
  - Deadband limits gyroscope sensitivity, so smallest movements are ignored to handle shaking hands, and it is enabled by default in most vita games. Disabling it will higly increase sensitivity of gyroscope.
- I forgot my custom hotkeys to open menu. How do I find it?
  - Open VitaShell and open the file ux0:data/reVita/HOTKEYS.ini. "Open menu=" has your hotkeys to open the plugin menu.
- I've set the startup delay too low on a game and now it crashes when launching it. What do I do?
  - Hold (Start) when launching the game. It starts the plugin in safe mode, with a blank profile. Then load your profile, change the startup delay and save profile in profile manager.

## Fixes for some Apps
- MiniVitaTV
  - Adrenaline
    - Fix Adrenaline crash when pressing the DS4 TouchPad button - Remap DS4 TouchPad to anything.
    - Fix Vita inputs on PSX games - Enable "Vita as virtual DS4".
  - Retroarch
    - Fix Vita inputs on latest versions of Retroarch- Enable **"Vita as virtual DS4"**.
    
## Known issues

- Menu not opening in Adrenaline
  - Change **Adrenaline Settings -> Graphics Filtering** to anything else **except** original.
- Menu not opening
  - Minimise app
  - Setup config you need while on LiveArea
  - Save it as Shared profile (Profile > Profile management > Save as Shared)
  - Go back to the game
  - Press **START**+**CROSS**(configurable under Settings > Hotkeys) to import Shared profile.
- "Buy more RAM" error popup on menu open - means there is not enough RAM for plugin to initialise it's menu. Seems to be caused by usage of other heavy plugins, especially ucdc and PSVShell.
